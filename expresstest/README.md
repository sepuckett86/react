This is my first attempt at using create-react-app and then adding server capability using:
<br />

1) Webpack <br />
2) Express

<br />
This also relies on js-yaml to save data to a yaml file permanently, instead of losing data every time the server refreshes.

## To use
```
npm run webpack
npm start
```
