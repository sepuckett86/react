## setmeup

This is my ideal set-up for a new React app.
<br>
The idea is to include:
<br>
--React front-end with create-react-app
--React Router for multiple page app
--React Bootstrap for styling
--Express back-end
--Enzyme, Mocha, and Chai testing capabilities
--Babel for transpiling
--Webpack for packaging

<br>

## Explanation of files added

To make sure browser styles are removed
```
setmeup/public/reset.class
```


## Explanation of all packages and how they were installed
## Global


```
npm, surge, create-react-app
```

## Local

## Installed with create-react-app
# react, react-dom, react-scripts

## Installed separately
# ajv
<br>
```
npm install --save ajv
```
This is necessary to remove an error.


# React Router
<br>
```
npm install --save react-router-dom
```
